		<header>What is this? (I don't even)</header>
		<p>Fridge Jokes is an entertainment web application oriented to people who have played the videogame Persona 4.</p>
		<p>During most ingame days, the main character has the option to check the fridge in his home. He may find a little surprise, usually food of different kinds, and the player will decide to interact (eat, drink, etc.) with it. Sometimes it will result in some bonus, or will turn the character sick.</p>
		<p>Some certain related videos on Youtube have a significant amount of comments mimicking the text shown during these interactions with the fridge, becoming jokes on their own. And the raison d'Ãªtre of this page is to collect these jokes and to show them in a fashion similar to the original videogame.</p>

		<header>Why create a whole website just for jokes that few people will really understand?</header>
		<p>For me, the developer, was a nice excuse to put my beginner skills in action, being this my second web project shown to the public.</p>
		<p>Thus, I hope this web application will serve me well in my future professional portfolio. (Written in 2013. At 2025, it has served me well!)</p>
		<p>Also, the internet is full of humour of all kinds, and there is always place for more.</p>

		<header>How do I stop the music? I can't see the controls.</header>
		<p>Press on the music bar on your left. A Youtube window will smoothly show up at your control. Click on the same bar to hide it again.</p>

		<header>Which framework did you use for this app?</header>
		<p>Originally it was made with jQuery and PHP 5.3. It had endpoints for likes and to send new jokes.</p>
		<p>This version is read-only, so I removed all backend functions. Now it's totally HTML and native Javascript.</p>

		<header>"Persona 4"?</header>
		<p><i>Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4</i>. A relatively famous japanese RPG from Atlus, for PlayStation 2, remade for PlayStation Vita and many modern platforms. It also has its own animation series and many spin-off games.</p>
		<p>The contents in this web application are mostly based on the original PlayStation 2 edition, although it has some little references to its previous issue, Persona 3. (Persona 5 did not exist back then)</p>

		<header>I haven't played any of this. Will I laugh anyway?</header>
		<p>You can try. Many jokes, as usual on the internet, are crossed with other memes. Some even can be easy to understand for everyone.</p>

		<header>How can I describe the kind of humour shown here?</header>
		<p>As Bryan o'Doyle said at <a href='http://www.koding.com'>Koding</a>: "well that's a perfect illustration of the specificity of appeal of various forms of humour; I laughed till the tears came, going back and forth through those panels. It is a shredding of dreaming and video games and psychoanalysis and pop culture and domesticity in this surreal space carved out of the multiverse."</p>
